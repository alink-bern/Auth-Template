# .NET 8 Login Template

This template serves as a comprehensive starting point for a .NET 8 Web API, specifically focusing on login functionalities. It's designed to facilitate seamless data access and manipulation, making it an ideal choice for building secure login systems for mobile apps, web frontends, or other services requiring user authentication.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- .NET 8 or higher
- .NET Entity Framework tools

## Installation

Follow these steps to get your API up and running:

1. Configure the secrets (see [Configuration](#configuration))
2. Create a migration (see [Database Setup](#database-setup))
3. Update the database (see [Database Setup](#database-setup))

## Configuration

You need to configure your secrets with the following information:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Development": "Server=server;Database=dev;User Id=username;Password=password;TrustServerCertificate=true;",
    "Production": "Server=server;Database=ProdDB;User Id=username;Password=password;TrustServerCertificate=true;"
  },
  "TokenSecret": "YourTokenSecret"
}
```

Replace `YourTokenSecret` with your actual token secret. Also, ensure to replace the `Server`, `Database`, `User Id`, and `Password` fields in the `ConnectionStrings` with your own database connection details.

## Database Setup

To set up your database, run the following commands:

Create a migration:

```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

Update the database:

```
dotnet ef database update
```

## Enhancing Security

While this template provides a solid foundation for a secure login system, you can further enhance the security by implementing the following:

- Global error handling middleware: This can help to catch and handle exceptions globally, providing a consistent response to clients and hiding implementation details that could be exploited by malicious users.
- Policies and roles: Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) can help to ensure that users can only access the resources and perform the actions that they are authorized for.
- XSS Protection: Use modern web frameworks like ASP.NET Core that encourage good security practices. Always encode dynamic data before displaying it in the UI. Sanitize user-generated HTML content to remove potentially harmful scripts or tags. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict which scripts can execute on your page. Set the X-XSS-Protection header to prevent reflected XSS attacks in older browsers.
- SQL Injection Protection: .NET provides built-in functions to prevent SQL injection. Use prepared statements with variable binding to prevent SQL injection. If you use Entity Framework or similar ORM tools provided by .NET, they automatically parameterize queries to protect against SQL injection. However, if you're writing your own SQL queries, make sure to construct and use properly designed stored procedures to encapsulate database logic. Validate and sanitize user input, only allowing expected characters and patterns. Avoid escaping user input as it can lead to mistakes and vulnerabilities.
